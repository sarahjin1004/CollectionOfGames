Collection of Games
===========
I built a web page in Javascript and HTML to organize a collection of games of different genres: arcade, board, and cards! This is my first experimentation with JS games and making my own website. <br>
You can check it out at: http://sarahsarcade.dynu.net/ <br>
As of now, I have these games implemented:
* Minesweepers 
* Catsweepers (variation of Minesweepers with theme, art, exploring CSS and Photoshop)
* Blackjack
